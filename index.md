# Transfer Learning and Hierarchical RL Study Group
## Fall 2018/ Winter 2019

 **Location**: MC 437 McConnell Engineering Building 
**Time**: Fridays at 4 p.m.

Our study group is concerned with the following two topics:
- Transfer Learning in robotics
- Hierachical Reinforcement Learning in robotics

We think these two problems are crucial forpractical applications of learning algorithms in robotics since collecting data with real robots is expensive and the search space for policies in real robotics applications is generally too vast. Transfer learning refers to the area of machine learning concerned with the deployment of algorithms trained on a __source domain__ to perform tasks on a __target domain__. Hierarchical RL refers to the family of techniques where the solutions to a reinforcement learning problem, usually parametric policies, have a hierarchical structure and whose components may be deployed separately.
